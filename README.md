Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
This repository contains my implementation of the Titanic dataset, as part of a machine learning project to predict the survival of passengers using various models.

Project Overview
The Titanic disaster is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project aims to use machine learning techniques to predict which passengers survived the sinking based on features such as age, sex, class, and other variables from the dataset.

The key tasks involved in this project include:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model training and evaluation
Performance optimization
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Kaggle Titanic competition. It consists of the following files:

train.csv: Contains data of passengers used for training the model.
test.csv: Contains passenger data for making predictions.
Models Used
In this project, I experimented with several models to achieve better prediction accuracy:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model helped achieve notable accuracy.

Installation
To get started, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-machine-learning.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook titanic-machine-learning.ipynb
Usage
The Jupyter notebook titanic-machine-learning.ipynb contains step-by-step code for loading the data, cleaning it, exploring relationships, and training machine learning models.

To run the model on your local machine, open the notebook and follow the cells.

Results
The final accuracy achieved using the AdaBoost model is 0.82. Future improvements could include more feature engineering and testing more advanced models.

Future Work
Explore deep learning techniques.
Further tune hyperparameters for optimized results.
Extend the analysis to more general survival models in different contexts.
